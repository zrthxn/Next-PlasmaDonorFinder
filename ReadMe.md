 ## Using Docker Compose
 
 1. Create a .env file and a .env_postgis file from the .env.sample file and  .env_postgis.sample. Simply copy the contents and setup required environment variables.
 
     Note : Make sure that the db settings in both the files are same.
 
 2. Install Docker and Docker-compose in your system. Use the following commands.
 
    For docker : https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
    
    For docker-compose : https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
    
 3. Create an empty directory named `postgres`. This will be the volume mount point for the db.
     ```shell script
    mkdir postgres
    ```
 4. If you simply wish to run the project, use the following command:
    
    ```shell script
     docker-compose up 
    ``` 
 5. If you want to develop using auto reload, use
    ```shell script
     docker-compose up db
    ```
    This will start the database container. Then you can start django by running `./django_setup.sh`
